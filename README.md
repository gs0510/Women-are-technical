# Women-are-technical
And capable of breathing fire :fire:

This repository is borne out of anger. Anger for not being considered techincal enough or that you have to lower the bar to hire more women.

My aim for this repository to be a document for all the women that are technical and all the ways that companies are sexist in either their hiring practices or the work environment. 

- Colder temperature in offices hurt productivity for women.
