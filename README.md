# Women-are-technical
And capable of breathing fire :fire:

This repository is borne out of anger. Anger for not being considered techincal enough or that you have to lower the bar to hire more women.

My aim for this repository to be a document all scientific studies that support the claims women make. For example how the offices are colder, or the gender pay gap(data to show the gender pay gap).

- Colder temperature in offices hurt productivity for women.

- Women volunteer more, women are volunteered more.
